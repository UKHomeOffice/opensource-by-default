Missing a License

Without a license a user cannot use a project as they might be sued!

It is also in the [GDS guidelines](https://gds-operations.github.io/guidelines/) to include a license.

At the Home Office we officially default to [MIT](https://mit-license.org/), if you feel MIT isn't suitable for your project please raise it at a tech-lead meeting.

You can easily do this with the web GitHub interface:

1. [Create a new file on this repo](../new/master?filename=license)
1. `Want to use a template?` should appear to the right, select `MIT License`
1. Select `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.`
1. Click `Propose new file`
